# RUNBOOK values — adapter zero (vllm-omni)

The repo-specific companion to the neutral `doc/RUNBOOK-rebase.md`
template: placeholder resolutions, evidence log, owner decisions, and
run-day fill-in tables for THIS adapter's cutover. Machine-readable
facts stay in `manifest.yaml`; this file holds operational values and
history only.

## EXT1 pin — evidence (DONE, 2026-08-01)

- Pinned SHA `0395bbe` = six commits (guard module + orchestrator hook
  + fail-closed root-anchored symlink-hostile atomic hygiene shield +
  baseline-under-lock ordering + errno-precise diagnostics + validated
  gitdir + no checkout fabrication).
- **Working-tree caveat (applies to §8 baselines):** the deployed
  checkout carries UNCOMMITTED owner changes (config.sh/§10 maps,
  config.py, debug_memory_store.py, test_watchdog.sh, skills, task
  scripts, nightly_rebase_cron.sh, …). The PR5 `shell_golden.json` was
  captured from this WORKING TREE (the deployed truth), so the golden
  describes live behavior, not the pinned commit's. Any comparison run
  from a fresh clone of the pinned SHA will differ from the deployed
  instance — baseline runs must use the deployed working tree as-is.

## PR6 preflight — evidence (2026-08-01, session-executed)

### No-live-consumer evidence (plan §1 re-verification: CONFIRMED)

1. **Scheduler scan**: root's crontab has exactly ONE entry — `0 16 * * *
   /rebase/nightly_local.sh` — a nightly ACCURACY/PERF CI over a third
   checkout (`/rebase/vllm-omni`), NOT the rebase orchestrator. Nothing
   schedules the orchestrator: `nightly_rebase_cron.sh` (designed for
   18:30 UTC) is present but NOT installed in any crontab/timer. No
   orchestrator process is running; the parent's `state.json` is the
   known Jul-25 mid-flight recording (`phase=local_testing`).
2. **Buildkite, 30 days** (`vllm/vllm-omni-rebase`, read-only API query):
   100 builds, ALL attributed — the pipeline's OWN daily schedules
   ("Scheduled build" on `main`, "Scheduled nightly build - Align" on
   `dev/vllm-align`), the owner's manual API builds (Jul 27–28 v0.26.0
   session), and webhook builds. ZERO unattributed; zero
   `imx_op_id`-stamped builds (expected — the copilot has never pushed).

### Preconditions resolved (with dates)

- **#2 tier config (2026-08-01)**: `AGENT_MODEL="claude-sonnet-5"` was
  untruthful on `api.deepseek.com` (silently served `deepseek-v4-flash`;
  the served-model guard refused). Fixed to `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`;
  `doctor --probe` verifies the eco tier round-trips truthfully. `.env`
  backup: `.env.backup-20260801-155809`.
- **#3 v1 rollback path**: `REBASE_AGENT_ROOT` points at the canonical
  checkout in `.env` — satisfied. (A STALE sibling working copy exists
  at `copilot/vllm-omni-rebase-agent` with no EXT1, and the settings
  default points there — the env override is what makes v1 runs import
  the EXT1-guarded code.)
- **#4 target venv**: `VLLM_OMNI_VENV=/data/zhoutaichang/rebase/.venv`
  (the parent's `REBASE_VENV`).
- **#5 DRIFT_TRIAGE**: all decided — #1 flavors frozen, #4
  manifest-built slug set, #6 map flavors, #7 declared-vs-computed
  mapping.
- **Doctor**: fully green (deps/env/gh/repos/backends/playbooks/moa/
  probe). **Lock-leak scan**: both vllm-omni checkouts' `locks/omni.lock`
  FREE. **Mechanical rollback rehearsal (timed): 5 s** to
  (v1 playbook resolved via `--plan-only`) + (external orchestrator
  `--dry-run` exit 0); the FULL timed rehearsal is run-day Phase 2.

### Frozen-SHA candidates for the §8 comparison

| World | SHA | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| deployed target `rebase/vllm-omni` | `05d0926e` | dev/vllm-align |
| copilot target `copilot/vllm-omni` | `a61d5c0f` | main (NOT the validation world per decision A) |
| upstream `rebase/vllm` | `ffd46bfab2` | (detached — parent wheel pin) |
| external agent | `0395bbe` | main (= EXT1 pin) |

## Owner decisions

- **A. Validation target world — DECIDED (2026-08-01, per
  recommendation)**: both validation runs operate on the DEPLOYED
  checkout `/data/zhoutaichang/rebase/vllm-omni` (dev/vllm-align).
  Run-day Phase 1 repoints `<target-repo-env-keys>` for the window
  (timestamped `.env` backup first) and Phase 6 restores/supersedes.
  EXT1's per-checkout flock covers both runs on the same world — the
  mutual exclusion it was built for.
- **B. GPU window — DECIDED (owner, 2026-08-01): 03:00 CST start.**
  Clock facts (verified): cron runs on `/etc/localtime` = **UTC**, so
  the perf-CI crontab `0 16 * * *` fires at 16:00 UTC = **00:00 CST**
  (it seizes all GPUs and kills GPU compute procs after a 1-hour wait;
  its tail can run past 03:00 CST). Window: **03:00 → 23:30 CST**
  (= 19:00 → 15:30 UTC), hard stop 23:30 CST — nothing of ours may be
  on GPUs at midnight CST. Two window rules: (1) at 03:00 CST confirm
  `nvidia-smi` shows the nightly's tail is done before starting; (2) if
  ext + v3 don't both fit one window, run Phase 3 (ext) in day-1's
  window and Phase 4 (v3) in day-2's — the Phase-3 restore step already
  reseeds the world between them.
  **`<gpu-device-set>` = `4,5,6,7`** — GPU 0 carries a resident ~139 GB
  allocation (avoid); 4 visible GPUs let the `gpu_4_queue` jobs
  actually EXECUTE (not hw-skip) in BOTH runs, maximizing §8 signal.
  Fallback under run-day contention: drop to `4,5` (the deployed cron
  precedent) — but the SAME set for both runs is the invariant, never
  mixed.
- **C. Buildkite schedule race — DECIDED (owner, 2026-08-01): pause
  both schedules for the validation window.** Pipeline
  `vllm/vllm-omni-rebase` → Settings → Schedules: pause "Scheduled
  build" (main) and "Scheduled nightly build - Align" (dev/vllm-align)
  in Phase 0; re-enable in Phase 6. Scope note (precise, post-CI-W):
  the v3 run pushes `rebase-val-nat-<date>`, a branch the schedules
  never build, so the ownership refusal is NOT the main exposure here —
  the exposure is comparison stability: a scheduled main build landing
  between the ext and nat runs would CHANGE the pre-existing-failure
  baseline (`rebase.ci.baseline_pipeline` main-branch query) mid-
  comparison, plus GPU/queue capacity contention. Pausing removes both.

## Staged-enablement seed baseline

Stage 1's deterministic-output diffs compare against the frozen
2026-08-01 report-only dry run over the live checkout: **54 jobs / 310
test changes, done/exit-0** (plan §5 PR5 row).
