"""End-to-end Strict review, offline.

Every other test in this suite exercises one seam. This one drives the whole
contract the way the reviewbot will: `start_strict_review` -> policy -> reserve
-> claim -> the real `pr-review` playbook over a real git checkout -> terminal
`run_status.json` -> `get_result`'s structured payload. Only two things are
faked — the GitHub CLI and the reviewer model — because everything between them
is what PR 2 changed and what a mocked-out test would stop proving.

It is the offline half of the plan's "end-to-end on a real PR" check: same
assertions, no network and no API key.
