# Simplification audit

Use this bounded audit when a diff adds or expands a helper, class, fallback,
compatibility branch, defensive copy or validator, lifecycle state, or public
behavior. It extends the [independent review contract](review-execution-contract.md)
and applies the ownership rules in [Code Taste](code-taste.md). It is not a
repository-wide cleanup pass.

Adapted from DeepSeek Harness's
[`dsh-find-simplifications`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/tree/master/.agents/skills/dsh-find-simplifications),
with repository-specific Agent Notes, Node packages, and protected seams removed.

## Prove consumers before calling code dead

Start with the changed or newly expanded symbol, config key, event, hook, branch,
or wire string. Use `rg` for the exact name and its call forms, then read the call
sites. Classify every consumer:

- **production:** runtime source, loaders, registries, entrypoints, generated
  dispatch, plugins, examples used as smoke paths, or external/public contracts;
- **non-production:** tests, fixtures, snapshots, docs, comments, and type-only
  references;
- **ambiguous:** reflection, dynamic import, string dispatch, serialization,
  compatibility shims, scripts, and examples whose production role is unclear.

No text match is not proof of no consumer. Check exported APIs, decorators,
registries, generated code, config/wire names, and public compatibility before
proposing deletion. A strong dead-code finding names the searched surface and
shows that only non-production consumers remain, or that the branch is
unreachable from every supported ingress.

Reject the candidate when a production caller exists and deletion would be a
feature decision, when an explicit compatibility or design contract owns it, or
when removal only moves the same complexity elsewhere.

## Audit defensive code by trust boundary

For every copy, freeze, validator, fallback, catch-all, rollback, or callback
capture, record:

1. where the value or failure originates;
2. whether the boundary is trusted and typed or external and untrusted;
3. who owns it after handoff;
4. the concrete failure the defense prevents;
5. whether another layer already enforces the same fact.

Preserve validation and ownership transfer at parsers, user configuration,
queues, model/tool JSON, durable files, workers, processes, RPC/wire decoders,
and native-resource boundaries. Same-process typed calls usually borrow their
declared values; hostile-getter tests, mutation after a documented readonly
handoff, or broad exception swallowing do not alone justify a speculative
contract.

Call code over-defensive only when the threatened behavior is unsupported or
already owned elsewhere and the duplicate defense has a concrete cost: extra
allocation, hidden fallback, inconsistent error semantics, public API growth,
state duplication, unreachable rollback, or dedicated tests for behavior no
consumer needs.

## Collapse duplicated lifecycle facts carefully

For asynchronous or resource-owning code, draw the owner and transition graph.
Map each sentinel, readiness promise, cancellation flag, terminal-result guard,
disposer, rollback list, and shutdown branch to the fact it protects.

Merge mechanisms that mirror the same liveness, readiness, settlement, or
ownership fact. Preserve distinct machinery when it separately protects partial
allocation rollback, first-terminal-outcome arbitration, callback containment,
worker/process ownership, synchronous publication, or dispose-to-quiescence.

## Report only actionable simplifications

Every finding must bind to a changed `path:line` and include:

- the exact candidate and why the current diff makes it relevant;
- production, non-production, and ambiguous consumer evidence;
- trust or lifecycle ownership evidence when defensive code is involved;
- the concrete maintenance, correctness, resource, or contract cost;
- the smallest safe `DELETE`, `DEFER`, `INLINE`, `MERGE`, or `MOVE` action;
- the behavior or compatibility that the action intentionally gives up.

Do not report typo cleanup, subjective complexity, a one-off unused local, or
"this looks defensive" without call-site and boundary proof. If evidence is
insufficient, record the gap in the internal check instead of publishing a
finding. The review bot reports deletion opportunities; it does not modify the
reviewed repository.
