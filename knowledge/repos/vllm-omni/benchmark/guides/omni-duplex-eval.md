# MiniCPM-o Omni-DuplexEval

`vllm bench omni-duplex-eval --omni <generate|evaluate|summarize>` is the
installed workflow for evaluating MiniCPM-o native-duplex output. Generation
uses the vLLM-Omni WebSocket endpoint; evaluation uses a separate
OpenAI-compatible multimodal judge. This exercises vLLM-Omni's duplex client,
artifact, and local-judge integration. It does not reproduce the paper's
original inference implementation or establish paper-score parity. ^[PR #6634]

## Selection and generation contract

- `Hothan/Omni-DuplexEval` contains six RTD and three PR Hugging Face splits;
  those names are splits, not dataset configurations. `--split` selects one,
  while omitted/`all` loads all nine. Local JSON/JSONL manifests and
  `--media-root` are supported; `--ids` and `--limit` filter after normalized
  samples are built.
- PR task semantics come from the split name when a row has no explicit task:
  correction, event reminder, or post-event reminder. Do not silently default
  an unknown split to a reminder task.
- Generation currently supports only `--mix question`. It converts question
  audio to mono 16-kHz PCM16 when needed, interleaves optional JPEG frames,
  and streams media units through `RealtimeDuplexClient`. Realtime pacing is
  required for scoreable media-clock timing; as-fast-as-possible artifacts are
  marked `clock=invalid`.

## Lifecycle and artifact contract

- The client periodically acknowledges playback while streaming, commits the
  input, waits for `response.done`, acknowledges the remaining playback, and
  closes the session. A response or close timeout is retained in metadata
  rather than erased; `response_done` therefore remains distinct from merely
  having a response file.
- Each generated sample writes `<response-root>/<split>/<id>.json` plus a
  sibling `.meta.json`. Metadata pins pace, clock, mix, FPS, unit size, model,
  response/timeout state, and the reference-audio SHA-256. Evaluation rejects
  `clock=invalid` unless `--allow-invalid-clock` is explicit.
- Text deltas are sentence-split and timestamped against the input media clock.
  Every accepted millisecond clock field is divided by 1000; wall-clock and
  media-clock values must not be mixed.

## Scoring protocol

- Prompt wording and window math are pinned by `PROTOCOL_PIN` to
  `OpenBMB/Omni-DuplexEval@ca3c122b4d4bf67afd6b18ea5e724b4561bdde48`.
  Changing either requires a pin bump and a recorded score delta.
- For RTD temporal scoring, a response sentence uses
  `start=max(0, sentence_start-2)` and
  `end=max(start+0.5, sentence_end-2)`. This keeps early responses instead of
  discarding negative pre-roll. Content scoring uses the full video URL or
  explicitly sampled frames; the frame-sample path must pass those frames to
  the content judge, not only to temporal scoring.
- PR correction scores the complete response. Reminder tasks score response
  text in each event's configurable post-start window, and a sample succeeds
  only when every required event succeeds. `summarize` aggregates RTD content
  and temporal means by split and PR all-event success by task.

## Evidence boundary

The PR author reported a stratified 27-case run—three samples from each of the
nine splits—with all generation and judge jobs completing. That is a smoke of
the 660-case dataset, not a full evaluation. The reported scores used
vLLM-Omni MiniCPM-o plus a Qwen2.5-VL-7B frame-sample judge, so they are
environment- and judge-specific; do not turn them into quality, latency, full
coverage, or paper-equivalence guarantees. ^[PR #6634]
