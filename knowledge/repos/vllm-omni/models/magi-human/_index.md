# MagiHuman — historical tombstone

PR #6357 removed first-party MagiHuman support at `main @ aeb348d8`: its
`MagiHumanPipeline` registry and pre/post-processing entries, the
`vllm_omni/diffusion/models/magi_human/` implementation, the model-extras
declarations, tests, and supported-model/feature documentation are gone.

At the immediately preceding snapshot (`40dcfdbb`), it was an audio-driven
portrait-video pipeline with base and super-resolution DiTs plus audio/video
VAEs. This is historical context only: it is not an active pipeline, support
claim, model-extras contract, runnable example, or review owner. Shared runtime
questions belong to [Diffusion](../../components/diffusion/_index.md).^[PR #6357]
