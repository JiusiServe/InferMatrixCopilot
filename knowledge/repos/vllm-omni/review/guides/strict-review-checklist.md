# Strict 审查触发式检查单

Train-distilled trigger→check lines (20-PR campaign + teacher traces
2026-08-15). The Strict reviewer injects the first 7,000 chars
(`knowledge.review_checklist`); keep the core inside that budget.

## Streaming / TTS serving

- `async_chunk` defaults to **False** (`OmniModelConfig`). Any gate keyed on it
  applies to EVERY async_chunk=false model (moss_tts, voxcpm2, higgs_audio,
  indextts2, qwen2_5_omni, ...), not just the PR-title model — demand scoping.
- Stream slots/sessions: release must fire on client **abort/disconnect** and
  on the unscheduled-reap path, not only `finished=True`; slot exhaustion
  degrades silently (HTTP 200, empty audio) — that is a blocker, not a log line.
- A speed/format constraint usually lives in BOTH the HTTP request model and
  the WebSocket block of the same protocol file — sweep the whole file for the
  constraint, not just the hunk's class.
- Per-request seeding/generators die under CUDA-graph replay (replay discards
  call kwargs); "seeded" in eager mode proves nothing about graph mode.

## Model executor / payloads / checkpoints

- mm-payload / `to_payload_element`: exact dim-0 match gates per-request
  slicing; a mismatched axis silently clones the WHOLE batch into every request
  (cross-request contamination lineage #4851→#4870→#4910). Any invariant change
  here needs a producer census: every `make_omni_output` implementor, hidden-
  vs scheduled-axis tensors, padded lengths.
- Model capability flags (`use_async_omni_output`, `talker_mtp_graph_safe`,
  `omni_pooler_payload_include_hidden`, ...): consumers read them via
  `getattr(model, ..., default)` — typos and dead flags fail silently; trace
  every consumer after a flag change.
- Async omni output and prefix caching are mutually exclusive
  (`_should_use_async_omni_output` returns False when `omni_prefix_cache` is
  set) — a PR touching one must be checked against the other.
- Legacy vs v2 codec/tokenizer selection must be gated by an explicit config
  marker, never try-instantiate-and-fallback: permissive `from_pretrained`
  never throws, so the fallback is DEAD and legacy checkpoints hard-fail.
- Never mutate shared config objects (`hf_config`/`model_config`) at load/init;
  later readers see the mutated value. Vendored files carry a "Vendored from
  <upstream> @ <ref>" header.

## Platforms / kernels / global defaults

- `vllm_omni/worker/gpu_*model_runner.py` changed → open the NPU twin under
  `platforms/npu/worker/` and check for the same code; `platforms/cuda/
  platform.py` changed → grep the same expression in `rocm/` and `xpu/`
  (copy-pasted branches drift; the same-bug-survives-on-siblings finding is a
  maintainer staple). Newly-required arguments must also reach `_dummy_run`/
  profile/warmup paths — the real path getting patched while dummy doesn't is
  the standard miss.
- Anything under `get_default_*` is inherited by every model on that platform;
  per-model overrides exist (`_DIFFUSION_IR_OP_PRIORITY_FUNCS`; cosmos3 forces
  native) — propose the override, not a global flip. Only in-repo caller of
  IR-op priority is `diffusion_worker._resolve_ir_op_priority`.
- Hardware gates must match the claimed support matrix (`>= 9` admits future
  arches; upstream uses `== 9` for FA3) — and check what CI hardware actually
  runs the gated path.
- Kernel-provider/priority switches need before/after latency AND same-seed
  accuracy per bundled change; `kernels.get_kernel` is unmemoized and
  `version=N` resolves a moving branch head, not a pin.

## Configs / deploy yamls

- `seed:` under stage-0 qwen3_tts propagates into every request
  (`tts_local_seed`) → per-row multinomial loop ≈40% throughput cliff; ~30
  deploy yamls and `docs/configuration/stage_configs.md` still ship
  `seed: 42` — removing it from one file leaves the fleet exposed; report
  exposed vs safe siblings separately.
- Yaml pins (cudagraph_mode, slot counts) often enforce CODE invariants — ask
  whether the invariant belongs in code, and audit the surrounding comment
  block: a comment now asserting the opposite of the new value is a finding.
- Deleting a value users copy from a reference profile needs an in-file
  tombstone comment (match the file's comment style) plus a docs sweep for the
  hazardous example.

## Dependencies

- New kwarg/API into an optional package: does the OLDEST version the
  `pyproject.toml` range admits support it? Docs pins (`pkg==X`) are not
  lower bounds; docs pin vs pyproject range vs actual requirement can
  three-way disagree.
- Commit timeline shows a described kwarg was later DROPPED → usually the
  compat fix working; verify via archaeology tools, report as `[resolved]`.

## CI / tests

- Tests select by pytest **markers** (`-m "core_model and cpu"` in
  `.buildkite/`): a new test file without `pytestmark` is collected then
  DESELECTED — CI green while never running it. Module-scope platform imports
  break collection on AMD/Intel/NPU pipelines (xpu pytests the whole tree).
- A test that cannot fail (try/except-and-continue, degenerate inputs,
  asserting the injected value, real objects monkeypatched away) outranks a
  missing test.
- Red gate at head: map the diff surface to the lane's coverage INCLUDING
  configs the lane's tests load — "config-only" is not inert when the red job
  loads that config; propose the single most plausible in-diff mechanism.
- L2 covers CPU/mock plumbing only; serving/entrypoints tests may not collect
  under the installed vLLM — classify as environment, not defect.

## Benchmarks / audio numerics

- `benchmarks/patch/patch.py` PCM capture vs `seed_tts_eval` consumers must
  agree on rate/channels (capture normalizes to 24 kHz mono; env overrides
  apply at capture only) — a fix branch merging upstream can create a
  semantic merge conflict here (double resample) that invalidates the PR's
  own WER numbers; on any merge commit, re-verify reported numbers at HEAD.

## Process norms maintainers enforce

- A PR fixing one of N problems in a linked issue: one comment names the
  remainder and asks for tracking or a split.
- An unexplained capacity/threshold retune riding along gets a
  benchmark-rationale ask.
- Duplicated machinery gets a CONCRETE shared-helper proposal naming both
  files — never a hedged "should we unify?" question.
