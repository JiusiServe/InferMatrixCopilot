"""The durable idempotency index: one run, and one *execution*, per key.

A bot that starts a review, loses the response, and retries must get the run it
already started — not a second full review of the same commit. Scanning for an
existing run and then reserving one is not enough: two concurrent callers both
scan, both miss, and both create.

Three separate problems, all of which have to be solved for the guarantee to
hold:

* **One run directory per key.** A blocking per-key lock, and a durable
  `<run_root>/.idem/<key>.json` mapping the key to a run id.

* **One execution per key.** Returning an existing id is not enough — the start
  path would still enqueue a second child. `reserve` therefore reports whether
  it *created* the run, and only a creation is enqueued.

* **Crash safety.** Reservation is several non-atomic steps, and a server death
  after the index entry is published but before the child starts leaves a key
  pointing at a run that will never execute — the retry sees a hit, enqueues
  nothing, and polls a corpse. A hit is therefore reusable only when its run is
  live or holds a real outcome; a reservation that never started is re-armed
  and relaunched under the same lock.

Scope is deliberately narrow: `start_strict_review` only. Keying generic
`start()` on a spec hash would be actively unsafe — `issue_answer` and
`issue_filter` carry `pr=None` and no head, so every issue task in a repo would
collapse onto one key and an answer for issue #1 could return the run for #500.
