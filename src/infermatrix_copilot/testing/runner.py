"""Single-test executor — port of test_runner.sh's `run_ci_cmd_with_watchdog`
(local mode; remote-exec was retired with the shell layer).

Timeout layering (invariant, pinned by tests): the **primary** timer fires at
`job.timeout_sec` and kills the whole process group (the shell's `timeout(1)`
only killed the direct child, leaving pytest workers holding GPU memory — the
outer Python killpg existed to reap them; here one timer does both). The
watchdog may kill earlier on log patterns. The **safety** timer at
`timeout_sec + PY_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_SEC` fires strictly later and SIGKILLs the
group — it only matters if the primary path itself wedged.

One deliberate divergence from the shell, by design (plan §7): a hardware
gate produces an explicit `skipped` outcome instead of the shell's rc=0,
which inflated pass counts and marked never-run tests complete for resume
(`phase3._shell_skipped` existed to undo that).
