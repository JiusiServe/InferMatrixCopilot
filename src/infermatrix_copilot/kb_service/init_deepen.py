"""``kb init`` stage 3, ``deepen``: code rules for hot modules, then the
shadow flip (design kb-init §7.3, §9 PR 3).

Depth pass. The PR window is the pin's own first-parent history (bounded by
``init.pr_window_count`` / ``pr_window_max_age_days``, measured from the
pin's commit time). The unit of work is a GROUP: the files of one module that
share one most specific owner (``init_coverage.most_specific``: a catch-all
prefix never wins over a component's), so a module whose files belong to
several owners is deepened once per owner — a hot file is never left behind
because its module's majority owner already has rules. Groups are taken by
churn in the window, highest first; a group whose owner already bears rules is
skipped (it adds nothing to the metric). For each other group one generator
call reads the group's code at the pin (byte-bounded, with line numbers) and
proposes rules with line-ranged evidence; the rules go through the shared
screening — the docs redundancy filter (D5), evidence inside the group's
files, pinned claims, placement, the advisory judge — and are appended to the
owner's rule page (never editing an existing rule; a full page spills to a
sibling). The pass stops when the rule-bearing PR-weighted coverage reaches
``init.coverage_target``, the budget runs out, or no hot group is left, and it
always says which in the record's notes (and so the PR body): a pass never
ends below the target without the reason and the hottest files still
without rules.

The same PR turns the repository's knowledge service on in shadow mode: a
textual edit of exactly the ``enabled`` / ``mode`` lines of the adapter's
``knowledge_lifecycle`` block, checked by ``check_flip_to_shadow`` and by
``config.parse_lifecycle`` on the result.

Write a rule only for a contract, invariant or pitfall the code relies on and
a change can silently break: an ordering, a pairing of calls, a state that
must hold, an interface other code depends on. Never restate the repository's
docs and never describe what the code plainly does. Write in the language of
the language sample.

At most 12 rules; every rule cites the exact lines that support it; name code
in backticks exactly as it is in the repository (a path, or path::Symbol).
