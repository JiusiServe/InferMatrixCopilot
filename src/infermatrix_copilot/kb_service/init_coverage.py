"""Coverage metrics for ``kb init`` (design: kb-init v3 §7).

Pure and deterministic. Two measures of how much of a repository its
knowledge routes reach:

* **module coverage** — the share of modules (``profiles.establish.
  scan_modules_at_depth``) whose every source file matches some owner's
  ``scope_prefixes`` in ``_routes.yaml``;
* **PR-weighted coverage** — over a window of merged PRs, the share of changed
  source files (counted once per PR that changed them) that route to an owner
  (*routed*), and whose MOST SPECIFIC owner's page carries rules
  (*rule-bearing*; see ``most_specific``).

Specificity matters because prefixes nest: a catch-all owner (``pkg/``) reaches
every file a component owner (``pkg/sub/``) reaches. If any matching owner's
rules counted, one rule on the catch-all page would make the whole package
rule-bearing and the metric would stop measuring anything (kb init pilot,
2026-09-30: 10% -> 100% from one module's rules).

An empty population counts as fully covered (ratio 1.0): there is nothing a
route could miss.

The owner table comes from ``owner_table``: a knowledge-side ``_routes.yaml``
when the repository has one, else the adapter manifest's ``review_routes``
(the precedence ``direct_routing`` applies), else nothing. A repository routed
by its manifest is measured exactly like one routed by a table; what differs
is that init never writes its routes (see ``init_stages``).
