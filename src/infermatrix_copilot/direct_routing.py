"""Direct-mode knowledge routing: the repo-neutral routing mechanism.

Its four entry points — `direct_knowledge_routes`, `direct_execution_budget`,
`direct_completion_result`, `direct_mandatory_review_guides` — are re-exported by
`contract.py`, which is the surface consumers import.

Nothing here names a served repository. Each repository's owner table lives in
its own knowledge slice, `knowledge/repos/<repo>/_routes.yaml`; repository
aliases come from `adapters/<repo>/manifest.yaml`. Every request resolves one
`KnowledgeView` up front and all reads inside it use that view, so an activated
knowledge snapshot takes effect on the next request without a restart.

They were moved out of `thin_mcp_server.py` because a downstream consumer
imported the four `_direct_*` privates from it through `importlib` — a coupling
that broke another repository at runtime whenever a server-module symbol was
renamed, with no build-time signal.
