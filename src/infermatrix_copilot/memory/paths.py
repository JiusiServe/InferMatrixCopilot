"""KnowledgePaths — the ONE resolver for every mutable-knowledge location.

Until the PR4d cutover activates, every member resolves to exactly the
location its consumer used before this module existed (byte-identity is
pinned by test) — the resolver is a pure refactor that gives the runtime-dir
cutover a single switch to act on later, instead of five scattered
path expressions. The per-repo runtime state home is
`<memory_db dir>/state/<repo>/` (the location `skills_runtime` already
used); the flag-on branch that redirects the LEGACY locations there lands
with the migration machinery (PR4d code), not here.

Debug-memory members deliberately mirror the historical PER-CONSUMER wiring
(they differ today and must keep differing until cutover):
`rebase_backend_db` (v3 agent tools), `shared_write_db`
(`_common.record_debug_memory`), `debug_read_layers`
(`agent_runtime` retrieval, adapter store first).
