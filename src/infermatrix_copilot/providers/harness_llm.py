"""`HarnessLLM` — LLM-shaped adapter over a harness transport, TOOL-LESS only.

Callers that today hold an `llm.LLM` (intent classification, ensemble
reducer/merge, output repair, chat) keep their `create()` call sites; under
a harness backend those tool-less calls become one-shot CLI invocations.
Any call that passes tools raises: agent steps must route through
`run_session` (the harness owns its loop), and a loud error here is the
guard against silently running a second, ungoverned tool loop.

Model selection: a harness serves `STRICT_BACKEND_MODEL` (else its
`ProviderSpec.default_model`). Per-call API-tier model ids are ignored — see
`create()`.
