"""Post-run session audit for harness backends whose native tools cannot be
disabled (cursor-agent today).

Productized from the Composer eval arm (`eval/dataset/run_cursor_arm.py`),
which caught a live out-of-bounds read (`~/.claude/skills/...`) only through
exactly this check. Product policy audited here: file reads stay inside the
session's containment roots (the PR-time worktree + the run dir), and a
read-only scope means no write/edit tool calls. The eval arm layers its own
extra rule (no PR-discussion access) on top — that is a ground-truth-leakage
concern, not a product one, and deliberately does NOT live here.

Detective, not preventive — the disclosed fallback of the tool-governance
decision in doc/RFC-provider-registry.md. Findings are surfaced as
violations for the caller to trace and render in RUN_REPORT, never silently
dropped.
