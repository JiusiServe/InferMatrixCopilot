"""Per-request view of the knowledge tree: the packaged copy or an activated snapshot.

Knowledge used to be resolved once, at import, from the wheel. The knowledge
service activates a new snapshot by atomically swapping a symlink, and a module
constant captured at import would keep serving the old tree (retired rules
included) until the process restarted. A view is therefore resolved at the START
of each request and every read inside that request goes through it.

Resolution:

* ``KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`` unset -> the packaged tree (``sdk._resources``), exactly as
  before. ``snapshot`` is ``"packaged"``.
* ``KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`` set -> ``realpath`` of it, taken ONCE per view, so a swap
  mid-request cannot mix two trees. A directory holding ``MANIFEST.json`` is an
  activated snapshot: its ``knowledge/`` subtree is the root and every read is
  checked against the manifest's sha256 (fail closed on any mismatch). A plain
  directory holding ``AGENTS.md`` is served unverified, for development only.
