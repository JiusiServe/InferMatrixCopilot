    restatements", "5+ near-duplicate findings".

    Matched on `_same_finding` — subject AND claim — and NOT scoped to a file.

    * The within-a-file scope let the commonest duplicate class straight
      through. When the same fact is restated by several lenses, they often

      different evidence for one fact — the four `trust_remote_code`
      description-staleness comments on pr4977 share a subject, not a
      vocabulary.

    Duplicates are MERGED, not dropped: the survivor is the richest statement
    of the finding, not whichever arrived first. Dropping the tail cost recall
    on both measured splits (train -.052 -> -.092, val -.003 -> -.122) while
    precision rose, and the reason is visible in the rationales — restatements
    differ in how precisely they state the causal mechanism, and that is
    exactly what earns recall credit: "Y states the causal mechanism precisely
    ('older get_kernel doesn't accept the kwarg, which would have made every
    fallback attempt fail') matching the GT reasoning". Keeping the first
