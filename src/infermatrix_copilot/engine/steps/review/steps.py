"""The read-only PR-review agent step.

PR review is eval-informed (see eval/ANALYSIS.md): deterministic gate checks
catch the merge-state/CI issue class no diff-only model caught; evidence-
grounded tool use makes the strongest arm precise; a domain checklist fixes
topicality; a verify-and-rewrite pass fixes actionability. The prompt data is in
`prompts.py`; the deterministic sweep/render helpers in `utils.py`. The domain
checklist and the sweep language come from the repo profile (design §V2.2.2),
keeping the core prompt repo-neutral.
