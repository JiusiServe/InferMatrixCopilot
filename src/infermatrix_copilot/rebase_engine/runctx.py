"""Run-resource lifecycle — `RebaseRuntime` + loop-scoped registry
(plan §4 / Rev 8 §3.4).

A runtime owns one run's process-lifetime resources: the substate handle,
named checkout flocks (e.g. the shared `omni.lock` every user of a checkout
must hold), registered finalizers, and the abort flag. The registry hands out
runtimes keyed by ``(run_dir, event-loop id)`` — asyncio primitives created
inside a runtime must never cross ``asyncio.run`` boundaries, so a second
`asyncio.run` over the same run_dir gets a FRESH runtime rather than one
holding another loop's dead primitives. Repeated sequential runs are the
normal chat/CLI pattern; the pinning test drives exactly that.

Teardown runs finalizers newest-first inside a bounded window and never
raises across the boundary — the caller's shielded `finally` (PR0's
`run_guarded`) depends on that.
