"""CI build lifecycle — the guarded-creation/recovery contract (Rev 8 §3.2)
plus the parent monitor's deterministic core (poll loop, no-run terminal
states, per-job retry, baseline root-cause comparison, authoritative final
reconciliation, pure log classifiers — ported verbatim where pure) and the
phase-4 round orchestrator (`run_ci_rounds`: push → settle → adopt-or-create
→ monitor → serialized debug dispatch → retry rounds).

Every build CREATION goes through `create_build_guarded`: a durable
``{op_id, state: intent}`` record precedes the API call, the build is
stamped with ``imx_op_id``/``imx_run_id`` metadata, and crash recovery
matches EXACTLY on that op id — zero matches re-polls boundedly (API
eventual consistency) then ESCALATES; multiple matches ESCALATE; a build is
NEVER re-created on uncertainty. Cancellation/rebuild is only ever allowed
for op-recorded builds.

The HTTP client is injected (a `CIClient` protocol) — the adapter's
provider wiring supplies the real one; everything here tests offline.
The agent-driven CI debug dispatch stays external (assembly wiring), same
as the test loop's debug_fn.

    """The phase-4 loop (parent `phase4_init_wrapper` parity, §3.2
    ownership rules): push → webhook settle → adopt-or-guarded-create →
    monitor → SERIALIZED debug dispatch → retry rounds.

    `push_fn(op_index)` returns a PushOutcome-shaped object (`pushed`,
    `pushed_commit`, `dry_run`, `reason`) and is the ONLY authority on push
    authorization — this loop never self-grants; `op_index` is the
    ledger-unique index for this round's push op id. `debug_fn(job)` is
    awaited one job at a time by construction (all agents edit the one
    shared worktree with snapshot/restore — concurrency would clobber
    snapshots; do not gather). Retry rounds: code changes present ⇒ push
    fixes and build fresh; none ⇒ a NEW op-recorded build at the same
    commit (incomplete/flaky recovery — the §3.2 ledger owns every build
    we create; adopted builds are monitor-only). Budget-timeout-only
    rounds fail immediately: neither retries nor agents fix an operator
    problem. A refused (no-run) build adopts the best sibling carrying
    signal, else the run has NO CI signal and says so.

    Resume: op indices start AFTER the highest index already in the
    durable ledger (`op_base`, auto-derived from `ops_dir` when omitted;
    the caller may raise it to also clear its push-WAL indices) — a
    re-entered run never reuses an op id for a different operation."""
