"""The declared configuration fingerprint (design §3.1, decision D3).

Two units are comparable only when their fingerprints were computed from the
same declared inputs. The fingerprint is ``sha256`` over a canonical JSON
manifest whose sections mirror ``fingerprint.covers``:

* ``playbook_yaml_sha`` — sha256 of the resolved playbook file
* ``settings: [key, ...]`` — the named Settings values
* ``prompts: [glob, ...]`` — sha256 per matching package file
* ``routing: [NAME, ...]`` — the named routing knobs (environment first, then
  the same-named Settings attribute, lower-cased)
* ``tools: declared_tool_set`` — the declaration's ``shadow_tools``
* ``knowledge_snapshot`` — the plan's pinned knowledge snapshot id, if any
* ``copilot_sha`` — the running code's commit
* ``resolved_models`` — the eco and performance targets after every fallback
  (``Settings.tier_target``): model, provider id, kind and source, so a change
  to a fallback such as ``agent_model`` changes the fingerprint even when the
  raw routing knobs are unchanged

A cover that cannot be resolved (missing file, unknown setting) makes the
manifest *incomplete*: the unit is recorded without a fingerprint and stays in
Tier 1 (the engine never compares runs whose configuration it cannot name).
The manifest itself is stored as a blob so two fingerprints can be diffed.
