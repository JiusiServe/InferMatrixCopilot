"""`enforce_mcp_policy` — the structural safety gate for the MCP surface.

The MCP server exposes the copilot to Claude Code / Codex, which are
non-interactive: there is no `[y/N]` and no human in the loop to approve an
outward write. So the guarantee *"the host cannot widen the server's
permissions"* must hold **structurally**, and it must not depend on the on-disk
`request.json` being untampered — a same-user host process could rewrite it
between reservation and execution. This gate therefore runs in **two** places
(design rev 5/6):

- at the **boundary** (the server, when a tool is called), and
- in the **child** (authoritative), right after it reads `request.json`.

Either way it re-derives a *safe* `TaskSpec` from raw input, refusing anything
outside the read-only V1 surface. The allowlist of kinds is `READ_ONLY_KINDS`
from `task_spec` verbatim, so the gate can never drift from the code's own
notion of what is read-only.
